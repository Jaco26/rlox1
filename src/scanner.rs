  From this chapter http://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html

  The first step in any compiler or interpreter is scanning. The scanner takes in raw source code
  as a series of characters and groups it into a series of chunks we call tokens. These are meaningful
  "words" and "punctuation" that make up a language's grammar.
